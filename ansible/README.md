# Ansible Tasks

## General Ansible Tips

* Dry-run your code by running `ansible-playbook <filename> --check` e.g. `ansible-playbook foo.yml --check`
* Always verify the successful completion of tasks using the following steps:
  * Run the actual code, login to the target hosts and verify whether the required changes are complete
  * An easier, time-saving way to run verification commands on multiple hosts from the Jump Host itself. This is possible by running the Ansible Ad-hoc command from Jump Host (in the same directory as `inventory` file) as below:
    * `ansible <hostname> -a "<command>" -i <inventory file>`
    * Examples:
      * `ansible stapp01 -a "ls -ltr /var/www/html" -i inventory`
      * `ansible all -a "cat /opt/data/blog.txt" -i inventory` ('all' is a special keyword - Runs the specified command in all managed hosts)
